# AeroSky OS üöÅ

**The Open-Source Operating System for Drone Swarms**



AeroSky OS is a simulation-first, open-source platform for controlling autonomous drone swarms. Conceived as an "Android for the Sky," our mission is to democratize advanced drone technology for critical applications like emergency response, search and rescue, and logistics, with a special focus on tackling the unique environmental and connectivity challenges of India.

This repository contains the hackathon prototype, demonstrating the core OS, a sample mission application, and a proof-of-concept app marketplace.

## ## Key Features

* **Swarms on Demand:** Built on the robust foundations of **PX4 Autopilot** and **ROS 2**, enabling complex multi-drone coordination.
* **Thriving App Ecosystem:** A framework designed for a plug-and-play app ecosystem. Developers can contribute open-source mission apps or offer premium solutions through a marketplace.
* **India-Specific Design:** Includes modules for integrating **IMD weather data** to navigate monsoon conditions and planned support for **LoRa/SQLite** for operations in low-connectivity rural areas.
* **Simulation-First:** Develop, test, and validate complex swarm missions in the **Gazebo Simulator** without risking hardware.
* **Freemium "Sky" Standard:** A free, open-source core (Apache 2.0) for the community, with a path to monetization through a premium app marketplace for enterprise users.

---

## ## Tech Stack

* **Operating System:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
* **Core Middleware:** ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco
* **Flight Controller:** PX4 Autopilot (SITL)
* **Simulator:** Gazebo
* **App Development:** Python 3
* **Marketplace PoC:** Flask

---

## ## Getting Started

### ### Prerequisites

* A fresh installation of **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**.
* Git

### ### Installation

All dependencies and setup steps can be installed by running a single script.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/aerosky-os.git](https://github.com/your-username/aerosky-os.git)
cd aerosky-os

# Run the setup script to install all dependencies (ROS 2, PX4, etc.)
./setup.sh
````

-----

## \#\# Running the Hackathon Demo

To demonstrate the full potential of AeroSky OS, follow this execution order precisely across four separate terminals.

### \#\#\# üñ•Ô∏è Terminal 1: Launch the Simulator

This runs the drone and the virtual world.

```bash
# Navigate to the PX4 directory installed by the setup script
cd ~/PX4-Autopilot

# Launch the Gazebo simulator with a drone
make px4_sitl gz_x500
```

**‚û°Ô∏è Wait for the `pxh>` prompt to appear before proceeding.**

### \#\#\# üîó Terminal 2: Start the Communication Bridge

This connects the simulator to ROS 2.

```bash
# Source the ROS 2 environment
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash

# Start the Micro-ROS agent
micrortps_agent -t UDP
```

### \#\#\# ‚è≥ Terminal 3: Verify Drone Readiness

This is a critical step to ensure the drone is ready to fly.

1.  **Wait 15-20 seconds** after starting the bridge.
2.  Go back to **Terminal 1** and type the following at the `pxh>` prompt:
    ```bash
    ekf2 status
    ```
    **‚û°Ô∏è Wait until the output shows `global position: 1` and the health flags are `true`.**
3.  Disable the GCS safety check for the simulation:
    ```bash
    param set NAV_DLL_ACT 0
    param save
    ```

### \#\#\# üöÅ Terminal 4: Run the Mission App

This runs the sample "takeoff and land" application.

```bash
# Navigate to your ROS 2 workspace
cd ~/aerosky_ws

# Source the workspace
source install/setup.bash

# Run the mission!
ros2 run autopilot_app mission_runner
```

**You should now see the drone take off, hover, and land in the Gazebo window\!**

## \#\# The App Ecosystem

AeroSky OS is designed to be extended through apps.

  * **Community Apps:** Developers can create their own mission scripts using our `autopilot_app` as a template. We encourage contributions for missions like search patterns, image capture, and more.
  * **Premium Marketplace:** Our proof-of-concept [Flask web app](https://www.google.com/search?q=marketplace/) demonstrates how enterprise users could purchase certified, high-performance apps for specialized tasks.

-----

## \#\# Roadmap

  * [ ] Hardware integration and testing on a physical drone.
  * [ ] Full implementation of IMD weather API for real-time storm avoidance.
  * [ ] Develop advanced swarm logic for formation flying.
  * [ ] Build out the full Flask marketplace with user authentication.
  * [ ] Integrate LoRa hardware for testing offline communication links.
